Incremental Processing
Captures and processes only new or modified data since last run
Improves efficiency by avoiding full data reprocessing
Change Data Capture (CDC)
Tracks record-level modifications
Identifies inserts and updates (delete tracking capability to be confirmed)
Grain Column Management
Enables duplicate detection
Facilitates clean MERGE operations into Silver tables
Record Ranking
Supports data prioritization
Note: Relevance for Silver ingestion needs clarification
Data Quality (DQ) Framework
Current DQ Rules:
DQ1: Null value detection in grain columns
DQ2: Duplicate record identification
DQ3: Historical variance analysis (today vs. historical averages)
DQ4: Sequential count validation between steps
Key Questions for Implementation:
DQ Rule Applicability
Which rules are essential for Silver layer?
Are all current rules adding value?
DQ Check Timing
PreDQ: What checks occur before processing?
PostDQ: What validations happen after processing?
DQ Failure Handling
Do failed checks halt the pipeline?
Or are they just logged for monitoring?
What's the escalation process?
